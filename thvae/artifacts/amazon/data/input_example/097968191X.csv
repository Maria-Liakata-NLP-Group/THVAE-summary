097968191X	I purchased this after I saw that another student had one and I love it ! It fits into your pocket and you can fold it to maintain patient privacy . I took it to clinic and 3 other RNs bought them that same day !	5.0	health_and_personal_care
097968191X	This is a very useful clipboard , & portable.Its not being sold here on Amazon ? ( says currently unavailable ) . I like this one better than the vertical folding one they have ASIN : B000KK5FR8 ( this version I am reviewing , won 't hit your elbow in your coat pocket or slide around ) .Glad I got the last one at least !	5.0	health_and_personal_care

097968191X	I bought this about a month ago and it has proven really helpful ! The only reasons I didn 't give 5 stars : It does not fit A4 paper ( the European style ) well , and most importantly , it is a little heavy.Other than these , it is almost perfect ! I highly recommend it ( especially for US ) !	4.0	health_and_personal_care

097968191X	Love this clipboard . I carry one daily and have done so for more than a decade . This is the best one I have found and I love that it fits in my white coat pocket . It is sturdy for me to write on at the bedside as well . I have shown it to everyone .	5.0	health_and_personal_care
097968191X	Works very well . I agree with other reviewer that it does have capacity limitations but easily carries what I need for daily rounds . Even if you don 't put it in your coat pocket it is less bulky to carry folded compared obviously to full size clipboard . Pretty expensive though ; I think they would sell many more if they dropped the price .	4.0	health_and_personal_care

097968191X	I love this thing . I gave it 4 stars because i prefer the vertical one to the horizontal one just because that 's the way i like to fold my papers , but this thing works great .
