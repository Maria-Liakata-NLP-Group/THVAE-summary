B00A0J4RS2	This is great stuff ! I like the smell and the burn is slow and building . If you don 't like too much burn use a little glycerin , that will help .	5.0	health_and_personal_care
B00A0J4RS2	If you are the type that wants his aftershave to tingle and warm his freshly shaved face , this is the very best . You will know you are in the presence of greatness when you use this fine aftershave . For manly men only .	5.0	health_and_personal_care
B00A0J4RS2	Love the burn and the long-lasting scent . If you 're looking for the " next level " bay rum experience , this is the aftershave for you . Classy packaging , good value and totally unique . 5 stars .	5.0	health_and_personal_care
B00A0J4RS2	Package got broken in transit . Glad it did . Smelled like cloves and stale baby powder . Do not reccomend to anyone .	2.0	health_and_personal_care
B00A0J4RS2	Strong burn , but a very nice and long lasting tropical aroma with cloves and other good spices . For this price I 'd recommend this to anyone .	5.0	health_and_personal_care
B00A0J4RS2	I was looking for something different and this filled the bill perfectly . From the very first splash it has become my favorite after shave . I am looking forward to trying the rest of the Captain 's Choice after shaves .	5.0	health_and_personal_care
B00A0J4RS2	The scent is really overpowering and reeks of cloves . Not a fan . Pinaud Clubman Special Reserve is what I 'm using now , and it 's much better .	1.0	health_and_personal_care
B00A0J4RS2	Hubby love it . I love the way it smells ! Very sexy . Completely happy with the product and will try others by this company .	5.0	health_and_personal_care
B00A0J4RS2	I highly recommend this product to anyone that wants a good , tingly aftershave . It has a good bay rum smell .	5.0	health_and_personal_care
B00A0J4RS2	Very nice product . Spicy with a bite well after application . Very soothing and comfortable finish . The only drawback that kept it from a 5 star was that the product aromatics don 't last very long .	4.0	health_and_personal_care
B00A0J4RS2	After using this a few times I find the scent seems to be Ok with heavy clove tones as others have noted . The bite is not as bad as others say .	4.0	health_and_personal_care
B00A0J4RS2	This has a nice full Bay Rum scent and will surely catch your breath with it 's nice warming sensation which lasts but a moment . This version is stronger the the original Captain 's Choice Bay Rum and has a bit more staying power for those that want the great scent to linger .	5.0	health_and_personal_care
B00A0J4RS2	Love the smell and a little goes along ways . I wish the bottle was bigger , so you have to use it sparingly .	5.0	health_and_personal_care
B00A0J4RS2	Many reviews talk about a burning and cloves . I get no cloves and just a very nice warming sensation after using this . I don 't get that stinging alcohol burn but rather like a hot towel on the face with spices . Highly recommended	5.0	health_and_personal_care
B00A0J4RS2	It wasn 't as good as i had hoped it would be. the overall packaging was good received on time but the product itself wasn 't what i thought it would be as it is a little to sweet for me .	3.0	health_and_personal_care
B00A0J4RS2	Great product , gives a really nice burst of heat without " burning " , and makes your skin feel smooth and fresh for hours . I 've tried four or five other Bay Rums , and always come back to CO9T	5.0	health_and_personal_care
B00A0J4RS2	Great warming sensation on the skin , and an emphasis on the spice notes of the bay . An awesome bay rum that isn 't a sweet , powdery , or clove infused type of aftershave . It 's the only aftershave my girl has stated I have to always have a bottle of on the shelf .	5.0	health_and_personal_care
B00A0J4RS2	not a very good after shave . Clubman is a better choice . I personally prefer the Clubman brand of bay rum .	2.0	health_and_personal_care
B00A0J4RS2	I thought I 'd try it and I will finish it but while it 's not bad , I just don 't care for it .	2.0	health_and_personal_care
B00A0J4RS2	I really have no complaints with this product . The amound of alcohol in an aftershave is a personal preference , I suppose . This one smells quite nice . It just has a tad more alocohol than I prefer in a splash . If you don 't mind an exorbinate amount of alcohol , this product may be for you .	4.0	health_and_personal_care
B00A0J4RS2	I like this product but had to give it away as it irritated my skin after shaving ( broke out in splotchy welts and had to put benedryl lotion on to get rid of them . Heard good things from others though so it 's probably just my skin sensitivity .	5.0	health_and_personal_care
