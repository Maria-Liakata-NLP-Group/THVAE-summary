159985130X	We recommend the Magnifier . We are able to read small print and see tiny images printed in ads . The light has been used as a backup flashlight . We gave it four stars because there is no case to protect it .	4.0	health_and_personal_care

159985130X	I just love this little gadget . Sometimes my reading glasses aren 't enough . I keep one in my pantry to read ingredients & expiration dates . I also have one in the stereo cupboard with all the wires and buttons that can 't be read . I love the shape !	5.0	health_and_personal_care
159985130X	This is a great little gadget to have around . We 've already used it to look for splinters and a few other uses . The light is great . It 's a handy size . However , I do wish I 'd bought one with a little higher magnification .	5.0	health_and_personal_care

159985130X	it 's a good led magnifier for most purposes. it should have a case , though. how can you protect the lens without some kind of case ?	4.0	health_and_personal_care
159985130X	This is a perfect magnifier to read the small print , or even larger print if the room is too dark . It 's very comfortable to hold for casual use -- I would get something else for reading books .	5.0	health_and_personal_care
159985130X	This has come in really handy in restaurants and for looking up numbers in the phone book . Small , portable , innocuous and invaluabe . Have purchased several to use as gifts . Everyone gets excited when they see it . Some waiters laught and produce ones they keep behind the counter .	5.0	health_and_personal_care
159985130X	This item was perfect for my use I since ordered 6 more in the plum color . Lightweight , easy to carry , use & other folks were very anxious to borrow it to view a menu . So now they each have their own & I have one for myself . : - )	5.0	health_and_personal_care

159985130X	I ordered two of these pocket magnifiers and am very pleased with their portability . The light projects when you slide it open and allows one to see clearly . It is particularly helpful in dimly lit restaurants whose menus have small , delicate font . I highly recommend this magnifier .	5.0	health_and_personal_care
159985130X	Nice and handy , construction seems solid . I use mostly to examine digital photos while shooting in the filed . I wish it comes with a little pouch or something to protect the lens and maybe a little more magnifying power , 5x vs 3x , that would have been a five stars .	4.0	health_and_personal_care
159985130X	I carry one of these with me all the time at work . With the integral light , it 's great for looking at small print and details on engineered drawings .	5.0	health_and_personal_care

159985130X	This product is a must-have if you cannot read small print . Now I can easily read instructions on medicine containers as well as all small print on ingredients , etc . Great for menus in restaurants and fits in a purse or jacket pocket . Also pick your favorite color : )	4.0	health_and_personal_care
159985130X	The light comes on when the item is pulled . This is much easier to use than the plastic bookmark magnifier and the bar magnifier I previously purchased . I was glad to have it lit when I needed to see the serial number on the back of an ipod .	5.0	health_and_personal_care
159985130X	I purchased this magnifier for my Mother . She has limited vision and this product has worked beautifully for her . I also use it occasionally and have been very satisfied with it .	5.0	health_and_personal_care
159985130X	They are getting very hard to find and the replacement batteries cost double the original cost of the magnifier . I couldn 't find any other product that did the job for me .	5.0	health_and_personal_care
159985130X	Upon receiving one of these I discovered the light flickers and it is extremely dim ! The light is unusable and this one is going back to Amazon for replacement . It appears behaving in a similar fashion as another customer ( S. Gaston " flower lady " ) experienced and reported !	2.0	health_and_personal_care
159985130X	As I get older , it gets harder to see small prints in low light situation , like in some restaurant with dim lights . This magnifier is small enough to carry around , has a bright light and good magnification . It really comes in handy .	4.0	health_and_personal_care
159985130X	I use this magnifier in restaurants to read the menu and the bill . It is portable and bright enough for dim rooms . I would have liked the shape to be longer to be able to read whole lines more easily .	4.0	health_and_personal_care
159985130X	We bought one for road trips and trying to interpret maps without having to strain our eyes . Really nice design , good tactile feel . I couldn 't figure out where the batteries were , sent Lightwedge Customer Service an email and received a response within 24 hours . If you need one I 'd recommend this one .	5.0	health_and_personal_care
159985130X	The screen of the magnifier is small . If you 're looking to read text this is not going to work . Though I have not attempted to replace the battery , battery container seems to be contained by a very small screw-A Phillips screwdriver-of which would have to be incredibly small . I dread having to replace his battery .	3.0	health_and_personal_care

159985130X	I have been told for 20 years that I will probably need glasses soon , but think I have avoided it by using a magnifier if I need to . This one is my favorite.-Jacqueline Marcell , Author ' Elder Rage , or Take My Father ... Please !

159985130X	Great magnifier in all aspects and loved it except it does not magnify 3X . I compared it to a large 3X magnifier glass I have and this product looks more like a 2x . I kept it to use at my desk but bought a Carson through Amazon for traveling . It is a 3X glass in my test and works great .	2.0	health_and_personal_care
159985130X	Very useful device . I have limited reading vision and this product is easy and handy to use . It helps a lot .	5.0	health_and_personal_care

159985130X	This is a nice , slim magnifier that looks good . It fits great in a purse ( or pocket ) and really does a nice job lighting up menus !	5.0	health_and_personal_care
159985130X	A well-made , pocket size magnifier ; very handy to use . The viewing area is somewhat limited , requiring the user to scan what one is reading . Still baffled at how to open it to replace batteries . There are no markings indicating where to open it . Perhaps batteries cannot be replaced , making it a throw-away item . No instructions were included .	4.0	health_and_personal_care
159985130X	I 've been doing more and more tiny component electronics projects . The integrated LED light works great for reading the text on a small surface mount IC , or checking out the quality of a solder joint and reading that tough to see color on a resistor . I 've gone through three other magnifying glasses before this and one am finally happy .	5.0	health_and_personal_care
159985130X	Could be better if the lens were larger . The led iluminator is good for the original proposal . Recomended for who needs to read small letters on small papers . To read a book , for example , could be a little bit hard because you need to move foward many times .	4.0	health_and_personal_care

159985130X	I bought this for a gift , opened it up and love it ! It is small enough to carry in a purse but big enough to see what you need . The light is great . The only downfall is that there is not a carry case for it . I will probably buy another for myself .	5.0	health_and_personal_care
159985130X	I bought it for a lady who has Macular . This is easy to carry with her and to be able to read when she needs it .	4.0	health_and_personal_care
159985130X	I gave these little lighted magnifiers to my friends for Christmas , and kept two for myself ; one for my purse and one for my desk . They are very study . The first one I bought has been bouncing around inside my purse for several months and is still like new . Great invention !	5.0	health_and_personal_care
159985130X	Most of the purses I own have black lining . Good luck finding anything black in black purse ! I chose this color because I can actually find it ! ! ! It works wonderfully in a dimly lit restaurant , when the print is really small , when I need a light & a magnifier to find the splinter . WONDERFUL .	5.0	health_and_personal_care

159985130X	I originally purchased one for my mother at Christmas time . She has poor vision and thought this would make a nice small addition to her other presents .

159985130X	I read a lot of the reviews for this lighted magnifier and the only complaint I saw was it did not come with a pouch or cover . However , the plastic case it came in works fine for this product . The light is very bright and the magnifier is very clear . I love it .	5.0	health_and_personal_care
159985130X	Just ok at best . The magnifying glass is distorted and the item is just ok . Definitely not worth the price , you can easily find the same item for 10 bucks . I bought it as a small gift to replace an item from Brookstone that was bought years ago and I was disappointed . Pass .	3.0	health_and_personal_care

159985130X	Product works well and is light weight . The only problem is the screw on the battery compartment . It is too small and I lost it when I tried to change the battery . It would be nice if they used a latch instead of a screw .	4.0	health_and_personal_care

159985130X	This magnifier has a rectangular lens and built in light , which is what I wanted.The lens has a slight distortion close to the edges but is acceptable.I was looking for a magnifier with multiple lights , but the single LED in this unit works very well .	4.0	health_and_personal_care

159985130X	I like to carry this with me when I go shopping as it is very light and a nice size to slip in a small handbag or pocket . The light really helps the magnification to make many things very easy to read such as instructions , ingredients , etc .	4.0	health_and_personal_care

159985130X	I carry this around in my bag ( just in case ) . I will have to make a little sleeve for it so that I can cut down on the lint & scratches that it collects , though . It works very well and is the perfect size--not too big to be gauche , not too small to be ineffective .	5.0	health_and_personal_care

159985130X	Love this product . I have had other magnifiers that don 't come close to the quality of this one . I am going to buy more so I can keep one in the car for maps , etc . You can 't go wrong purchasing this product .	5.0	health_and_personal_care
159985130X	Problem solved with this baby ! It 's cute and makes menus easy to read even in the most dimly lit venues . It has a nice weight to it and there 's been no issue with paint chipping or peeling , even though it gets constantly jostled around in my bag ( which contains everything but the kitchen sink ) .	5.0	health_and_personal_care
159985130X	I purchased 2 of these on January 11 , 2011 , one for me and one for my wife . We are both pleased with the magnifier . The lense is crystal clear and provides ample magnification . The LED provides bright and welcome light . I highly recommend this product .	5.0	health_and_personal_care
