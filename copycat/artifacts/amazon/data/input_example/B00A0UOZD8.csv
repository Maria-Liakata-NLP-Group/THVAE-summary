B00A0UOZD8	I find it a bit too big , uncomfortable.They need to work on the size of this toys so we can actually feel pleasure while using it . Pleasure while working the muscle is what this toy is about or not ? Btw , the fun about its vibration when the internal balls gets near each other ... hmmm I m still waiting on this effect.Feeling cheated .	2.0	health_and_personal_care

B00A0UOZD8	They were a little bigger than I expected . After the first few days I got used to them . Over all they seem to be helping so far . I 'm willing to try anything at this point to not pee everywhere every time I sneeze .	4.0	health_and_personal_care
B00A0UOZD8	Not weighted much at all . Elongated design was difficult to get into place . Cheap plastic molding had to be trimmed and filed smooth before I could use . Cheap design , glad I didnt pay much for this .	2.0	health_and_personal_care

B00A0UOZD8	These were huge ... Like golf ball size ... I don 't get how that exercises your muscles . : / I do not recommend them .	1.0	health_and_personal_care
B00A0UOZD8	I don 't really have anything to compare this product to , it 's kinda big but the smooth exterior makes it pretty easy to use , the string is hard plastic though and needed to be readjusted fairly often . They seem to be helping though , they aren 't uncomfortable when walking around .	4.0	health_and_personal_care
