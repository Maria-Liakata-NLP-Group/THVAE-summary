B00A0J086C	Axe has continued to increase their line of male skincare and their Axe Shave Gel is not slump . I 've generally been used to using Edge as my shave gel but the Axe works just fine . The scent is a little sweet and foams easily . Nothing to complain about here .	5.0	health_and_personal_care
B00A0J086C	17yr old boy who shaves and has sensitive skin along with normal teenage skin with occasional break outs. he love this stuff says it does not irritate his skin like others , smooth shave , and smells great . He also says it does not make him break out or burn an area that is broken out if he gets it on a pimple .	4.0	health_and_personal_care
B00A0J086C	Like all the other Axe products I 've tried this has a strong fragrance which is quite pleasant . The gel generates quite a bit of lather and results in a good clean shave . I found that I preferred the Shield version to the Chilled .	5.0	health_and_personal_care
B00A0J086C	This is a really great shaving gel . I highly recommend it . It foams perfectly and has a smooth , clean sensation as you shave . Thank you .	5.0	health_and_personal_care
B00A0J086C	I am used to using the .99 cans of shaving gel and now I know what I have been missing . I have used this for the past 30 days . It has left my skin smoother and with fewer irritations or nicks . Either you like Axe products or you don 't , but this is worth checking out .	5.0	health_and_personal_care
B00A0J086C	Hubby likes it for his sensative face and I steal some for my legs . He is very picky but no complaints from him with this version of Axe . He usually uses Edge gel for sensative skin actually says this protects better without the burn .	5.0	health_and_personal_care
B00A0J086C	This product did a great job , it smells good & I like the choice of ingredients . Yes , it 's an interesting choice of ingredients . It smells better & peachier than theNivea For Men Sensitive Shaving Gel , 7-Ounce Canister . I recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin .	5.0	health_and_personal_care
B00A0J086C	This is somewhat comfortable , but I found the smell horrible . I didn 't feel like it really cleaned . Competitors , such as Edge , smell better and you feel like more dirt has been removed.Also , the texture of the gel reminded me of the old creams from decades ago , like Barbisol and Colgate.It 's a fair product , but I would look elsewhere .	3.0	health_and_personal_care
B00A0J086C	I am always looking for shaving gel that works . I like this stuff because it works well . You put it on , wait a second and shave . Smells good too . No real complaints here . Only real complaint is the cost . If it had been lower it would have gotten 5 stars .	4.0	health_and_personal_care
B00A0J086C	It 's cooling and soft on the skin , great for shaving and not getting cut . Feels good well after the shaving is done and has pleasant scent that I 've grown to like a lot . More quality than Gillette shaving cream products , in my opinion .	5.0	health_and_personal_care
B00A0J086C	My grandsons think anything with the Axe label is great and love the smell . They have used many different products and so far love them all .	5.0	health_and_personal_care
B00A0J086C	This Gel compares very well to Gillette Gel which I 've been using for years . I find this Gel softens just a little bit more for a smoother shave . If I can find it at a comparable price to Gillette Gel I would use it . Othewise , I 'd stay with Gillette 's tried and true formula .	4.0	health_and_personal_care
B00A0J086C	I like the bottle design , but it foams too quickly , and a lot ! At one point I could not find my nose in the midst of the bubbly effervescence .	4.0	health_and_personal_care
B00A0J086C	It 's not the cheapest shaving cream , but it goes on nice , and has a nice aroma . I like it and will probably continue to use it in my " rotation " of shaving creams .	4.0	health_and_personal_care
B00A0J086C	I love this shaving Gel . Very good on the skin , Foams uo nice and leaves face smooth and clean feeling	5.0	health_and_personal_care
B00A0J086C	This shaving gel lathers up well and has a nice scent . This formula contains many cooling ingredients as well as menthol.The lather grows in abundance and is light blue in color and almost transluscent.Use sparingly . My first experience with it had given me enough foam for two shaves.Made in USA .	4.0	health_and_personal_care
B00A0J086C	A nice refreshing shave gel that works great . Easy to apply and helps the razor glide across the face easily . Has a nice smell and leaves the face feeling refreshed . This is pretty pricey compared to other shave gels and I think those work just as good as this .	4.0	health_and_personal_care

B00A0J086C	This shave gel works really well . When I used it my face seemed to get a lot less nicks and cuts , and my shave was even closer than normal . I used it with my Mach 3 razor and was really impressed with the results .	5.0	health_and_personal_care
B00A0J086C	Cheaper than Edge sensitive skin and gives a better shave than Barbasol . I use a safety razor with imported blades .	5.0	health_and_personal_care
B00A0J086C	This gel has a nice aroma to it but for actual use it 's nothing out of the ordinary.I 've used much better products than this.Actually leaves a bit of a film residue on your face .. not pleasant .	3.0	health_and_personal_care
B00A0J086C	I 've enjoyed using my Axe Chilled Shave Gel . It lathers up great , helps me get a real nice close shave , smells great , and leaves me with a nice cool feeling on my face . This is a product I look forward to using in the morning .	5.0	health_and_personal_care

B00A0J086C	This shave gel is pleasant and smells very good . It feels cool going on and keeps the skin feeling fresh and bumpfree after shaving . The product is blue and goes on white of course . Leaves my skin soft and smooth and most importantly cooled down . It feels nice here in Florida in the hot weather to use a product thats cooling .	4.0	health_and_personal_care
B00A0J086C	Excellent product . A little goes a long way . It smells so good ! And the ingredents are great such as jojoba seed , grape seed , and cucumber extract and other great ingrendents . Axe has done a lot to atcually make some good face products for men . I will continue to buy there new line on products .	5.0	health_and_personal_care
B00A0J086C	My husband has been shaving with this for two and a half weeks now and he 's hooked . He gets a smooth shave , and I know this , because he has me feel it afterward , and his skin doesn 't get dry or tighten up , so he 's given up using aftershave lotion . He rates this five stars , so I do too .	5.0	health_and_personal_care
B00A0J086C	I am always quite skeptical when a skin care product advertises " chilled " or " cooling " as an attribute like this one does , but I will admit it leaves a pleasant little tingle that does feel a bit cooling . Overall it offers a good shave , the scent is pleasant and very muted , and it is a good product .	4.0	health_and_personal_care
B00A0J086C	I liked the cool feeling and scent of this shaving gel . My husband complains that most shaving gels are hard to use since it slips out of your wet fingers . For whatever reason this one does not . It stays on the skin instead of slipping of and had a very refreshing feel and scent . That makes this favorite shaving gel so far .	5.0	health_and_personal_care
B00A0J086C	Both my son and my husband love Axe and all their products . It keeps them smelling good which is always important . They both loved the shave gel and both found it worked well and protected their skin without any harsh reactions . A +	5.0	health_and_personal_care
B00A0J086C	My son uses everything Axe and loves it . This product is no different . It provides the result that it is supposed to and the best thing is that Axe products are resonably priced . He especially likes the shaving products as he has a heavy beard and says Axe is one of the best . Recommend	4.0	health_and_personal_care
B00A0J086C	Overall this is an excellent product . It has a strong scent like most Axe products so keep that in mind when purchasing . The gel is a little foamy and came out a little messy that to me was the only negative .	4.0	health_and_personal_care
B00A0J086C	Axe Shave Gel Shield is better than the average shave gel as it more readily foams up in your hand . It has a fresh scent and will leave skin feeling clean and refreshed after a hot shave . Shave Gel Shield is a welcome addition to Axe 's expanding line of men 's grooming care products .	4.0	health_and_personal_care
B00A0J086C	This Axe Shave Gel ( Shield ) is not as moisturizing as the Nivea for Men Q10 Shaving Gel or the Dove Shaving Gel . This shaving gel is not bad , it 's just that the Nivea Q10 and Dove Shaving Gels are better .	3.0	health_and_personal_care

B00A0J086C	I am biased as I love AXE products . This shave gel doesn 't disappoint . It is great for application for any part of the body before shaving and makes the shaving experience , might I dare say , enjoyable . Love it .	5.0	health_and_personal_care
B00A0J086C	Chilled is an appropriate name for this shaving gel as it really does leave one 's face feeling cooled . The scent is exactly what I was expecting and it isn 't too strong at all . I got a great shave with this gel .	5.0	health_and_personal_care
B00A0J086C	Very pleasant smell , nice lube for the face , and seems to actually help reduce the small red bumps I sometimes get when I shave . This is a product I 'd use regularly .	4.0	health_and_personal_care
B00A0J086C	Nice lather with a simple rub of the hands . The foam was as nice as other high quality shave foam . No mess , no fuss , no issues , just simple shaving with a clean scent , and no irritation . It performed as well as foam and for the cost a little goes a long way .	5.0	health_and_personal_care

B00A0J086C	This shaving cream is good for price . Spend about $ 10 or more and get a product containing glycerin and I can assure you that you will have an excellent shave . Check out Taylor of Old Bond Street !	2.0	health_and_personal_care
B00A0J086C	I didn 't care for this one at all . Compared to Edge , it leaves a sticky residue on my face that I have to wash off with soap and gets very foamy out of the can rather than on the face .	1.0	health_and_personal_care

B00A0J086C	My boyfriend / significant other has sensitive skin ; he loved the slightly minty / green tea ( ? ) / cucumber scent of this , it didn 't irritate his skin , no razor burn , just a nice smooth shave . He loved this until he tried the Dove Sensitive , which he loves even more and plans on buying from now on .	5.0	health_and_personal_care
