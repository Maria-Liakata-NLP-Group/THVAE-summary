1935009656	This is a great magnifier . I read the reviews of a lot of these before I ordered this . I need a magnifier to be able to read the small lettering on my Blackberry . This fits the bill . It 's small , can carry it along with my Blackberry , and it looks sharp . A good purchase .	5.0	health_and_personal_care
1935009656	My husband is a maintenance electrician and loves this light . He is of the older generation and getting inside a machine and being able to see numbers clearly is so beneficial . It 's also priced right !	5.0	health_and_personal_care

1935009656	As I get older I am also unable to see small text . This magnifier is perfect . It allows me to see the smallest text and it comes in very handy when plucking my eyebrows too . Bought a smaller one to carry in my handbag .	5.0	health_and_personal_care
1935009656	it is exactly as advertised ... i like the magnifier with its extra strong lens button in the regular lens ; the light is brighter than the other brands ... however it is bigger than the other brands and i emailed the company about the size issue last year .. so four out of five stars	4.0	health_and_personal_care
1935009656	bigger then i thought , but thats not a bad thing. light is bright and glass is big . . .	4.0	health_and_personal_care
1935009656	This so called magnifying glass does not magnify . It is not much better than plain glass with a light . In short don 't waste your money buying it . I wanted a hand held magnifying glass with an LED light , well I did at least get the LED light .	1.0	health_and_personal_care
1935009656	A very good magnifier . And the LED produces a very sharp light.Since it is an LED it should not need new batteries for quite a while.I bought this because I needed to read numbers on the back of a watch and none of the others were good enough . This one did it right away .	5.0	health_and_personal_care
1935009656	Purchased both this one and the Carson 5x . Two of each . This one is superior , tho about twice the size . For ( semi ) stationary use it is my choice .	5.0	health_and_personal_care
1935009656	I love this magnifier .. it fits in my purse and the light is a wonderful plus ... I would highly recommend this product ..	5.0	health_and_personal_care
1935009656	Exactly what I expected . I 'm very happy with this item . It 's not fancy , batteries are included and does the job very well.JEAN.	3.0	health_and_personal_care
1935009656	For the price this little magnifier works well for routine things like reading labels in the grocery , restaurant menus and the like . But , I wouldn 't want to read a book with it.The sliding cover keeps fingers off the lens and the light is bright . Uses three AAA batteries , not included .	4.0	health_and_personal_care

1935009656	When you get mature ( ok , old ! ) your eyesight sometimes needs a little help . This handy magnifier and light is just the ticket to help .

1935009656	I like this thing . Works well , except the light switch is iffy . You have to jiggle the lense to get the light on sometimes . Otherwise it works very well .	4.0	health_and_personal_care
1935009656	I bought this for my husband and he loves it . My only complaint is I wish the stronger magnifying part of this were a bit bigger area . Other than that it 's wonderful . I like the case for protection and the light works great too .	4.0	health_and_personal_care
