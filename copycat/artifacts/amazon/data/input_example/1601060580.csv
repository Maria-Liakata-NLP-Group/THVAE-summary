1601060580	If you 're the person who never has a comeback for a pitiful " Yo mama " joke a friend told , then you need this . Impress all your friends by making them think that you actually made up the comebacks yourself . At least that 's what I do .	5.0	health_and_personal_care
1601060580	I ordered this from Amazon after flipping through it in a store . The pages I read in the store must have contained the only witty , clever retorts in the book . For the most part these are dumb , truly insulting or both . I bought this as a gift but ended up not giving it to the intended giftee .	2.0	health_and_personal_care

1601060580	This book is a riot of witicism and insults . Even if you don 't memorize your favorite come backs you will get a good laugh from the wit between the pages .	5.0	health_and_personal_care
1601060580	The comebacks and insults in this book are truly lame . Most were old , bad lines . I was embarrassed just reading these let alone using them .	1.0	health_and_personal_care

1601060580	It 's okay , and the idea is funny . But there are some " comebacks " that are really old or dated . When I asked my teenager his comment is " very lame . "	3.0	health_and_personal_care
