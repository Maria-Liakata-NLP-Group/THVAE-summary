9533223510	I bought this for my baby who was 3 months old , because I was looking for something that will give her a nice fresh scent other than a powdery smell , this does the job but it 's not the scent I wanted . The scent is not bad , but I wanted some more refreshing if that make sense . But over all it 's not bad .	3.0	health_and_personal_care

9533223510	I had read so many rave reviews about this product and was expecting a really fresh fragrance . However , it was a bit too acrid for me and dried my skin out a bit . The strong tone seemed like it was more of a male fragrance than anything else .	2.0	health_and_personal_care

9533223510	It 's okay ! It has a very distinctive odor ... I like it after a shower ... I don 't have anymore left .. It use to smell better in the past when I use to buy it in the 80 's .. It seems like they changed the ingredients ..	3.0	health_and_personal_care
